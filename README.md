## Story
Complete puzzles to make your way through to the "treasure" that lies in the vault

Story Idea #1:
The bank hires a security team to create the most technologicallyadvanced protection system possible. It has holographic wires, dynamic passcodes, and more.
However, no system is perfect. As it turns out, the security design team wanted to be able to get into any of system it has designed before.
As a result, they created a back-door for themselves.
Their codes are sophisticated, but they're solvable. Only people on the security design team know the solutions though.
Your (the player's) intel says that the mazes on the walls of the room are the first clues to a passcode that will lead you on a series of hints to break in...

Story Idea #2:
You're in the world of Inception, trying to pull a dream-heist. THe dreamer's subconscious populated the bank vault with the secret information.
However, the subconscious part of the dreamer's brain needs to communicate with the conscious part of their brain, in case the conscious part needs access to those secrets.
Thus, the subconscious left clues all around the vault entrance that only the dreamer could solve.
But we know the dreamer, so we (the player) have to think like them to solve the problems and break in.
